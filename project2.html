    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This project analyzes the 2021 T-Mobile breach as a cybersecurity case study. It explains how the
      breach happened, what data was exposed, how many people were affected, and what actions were taken
      after discovery (including investigation, identity protection offers, and legal/financial outcomes).
    </p>
    <p>
      The paper also highlights broader lessons about risk, weak security configurations, the impact of
      stolen personal data, and why continuous security improvement and monitoring matter.
